# MapMe


Requirements: 
Java 1.8
Glassfish 4.1.1
Eclipse

Technologies involved in my application:
MVC framework/technologies
Java Server Face 2.0+ (JSF2.0+)
Java EE
Javascript
XHTML/HTML
JSP
Google Maps API
Facebook API
REST Web Services (Facebook API)



A web application that runs with google api and facebook rest api provided here. 

There are multiple versions of my web app. I like to play with different kinds of technologies and see the output with a web application to see how I can apply this in a real life application. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have. 


This version of my application plays with concurrency, concurrent programming, synchronization, multithreading programming, and more. 

You can also incorporate facebook features onto this application, please lok at SimplePractice.java; also, here is a good video describing the simplicity of adding facebook application onto this application: [Facebook features in the web site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxSKLgsSbsU)

I will also create another version for Ruby on Rails will let you know when I add it onto github.

Directions:
1.) Import project onto eclipse. Go to Java Build Path, add all the .jar files inside MapMe/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib

2.) Start Glassfish server

3.) Run MapWorld.jsp on server

4.) Enjoy, and thank you
