# MapMe

Requirements: __
Java 1.8__
Glassfish 4.1.1__
Eclipse__

Technologies involved in my application:__
MVC framework/technologies__
Java Server Face 2.0+ (JSF2.0+)__
Java EE__
Javascript__
XHTML/HTML__
JSP__
Google Maps API__
Facebook API__
REST Web Services (Facebook API)__



MapMe is a web application built on Java EE and JSF using MVC technology. The application lets you type an origin location, a destination location, and simply returns the distance. I calculated it using the haversine formula, and Google map's API. I made this so that I could play with the different kinds of technologies that are available and to broaden my skillset.
I play with different kinds of technologies and see the output with a web application to see how I can apply this in a real life application. There are multiple versions of this. This particular version of my application plays with concurrency, concurrent programming, synchronization, multithreading programming, and more. I hope you enjoy this as much as I have. __

You can also incorporate facebook features onto this application, please lok at SimplePractice.java; also, here is a good video describing the simplicity of adding facebook application onto this application: [Facebook features in the web site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxSKLgsSbsU)__
